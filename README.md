## Buildly

Buildly is an AI‑powered platform (inspired by Lovable AI) that lets users build functional websites and full‑stack web applications using simple text or voice prompts, without needing to write traditional code.

Instead of manually wiring frontends, backends, and integrations, Buildly automatically generates the code, backend services, and necessary integrations, making app creation accessible for everyone from beginners to experienced developers.

The platform is designed around:
- **Natural language first**: Describe what you want in plain language and let the system generate working software.
- **An intuitive editor and chat interface**: Refine ideas, adjust behavior, and iterate on features through an editor and conversational UI.
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quickly turn ideas into running online tools and applications.

> **Status:** This project is a work in progress. Many controllers, services, and features are still under active development, and the API and behavior may change frequently.
